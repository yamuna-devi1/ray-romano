      <h3>JAMIE FLOYD: UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an
        eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone.
        It is CRAZY. But <br> we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano
        and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"

     <h3> DONNA AND SCOTT:  RESCUED RENOVATION</h3>
     <br>
      <p>
        "Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. 
          We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know<br> it, there will
          be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"

      <h3>DAVID SIEGEL:  DOUBLED THE VALUE</h3>
      <br>
      <p>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut <br> renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home improvements."</p>
